    </p>
    <p>
      Two years ago I was travelling by diligence in the Sahara Desert on the
      great caravan route, which starts from Beni-Mora and ends, they say, at
      Tombouctou. For fourteen hours each day we were on the road, and each
      evening about nine o'clock we stopped at a Bordj, or Travellers' House,
      ate a hasty meal, threw ourselves down on our gaudy Arab rugs, and slept
      heavily till the hour before dawn, drugged by fatigue, and by the strong
      air of the desert. In the late afternoon of the third day of our
      journeying we drove into a sandstorm. A great wind arose, carrying with it
      innumerable multitudes of sand grains, which whirled about the diligence
      and the struggling horses, blotting out the desert as completely as a
      London fog blots out the street on a November day. The cold became
      intense, and very soon I began to long for the next halting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do we stop to-night?" I shouted to the French driver, who, with his
      yellow toque pulled down over his ears, was chirping encouragement to his
      horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sidi-Hamdane," he answered, without turning his head. "At the inn of 'Fin
      Tireur.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours later we drew up before a low building, from which a light
      shone kindly, and I scrambled down stiffly, and lurched into the
      longed-for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a man in the doorway, a short, sturdy, middle-aged Frenchman,
      with strong features, a tuft of grey beard, heavy eyebrows, and dark,
      prominent eyes, with a hot, shining look in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Bon soir, m'sieu</i>," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Bon soir!</i>," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was my host, the innkeeper whom the driver had called "Fin Tireur."
    </p>
    <p>
      I found out afterwards that he was not only landlord of the desolate inn,
      but cook, garçon; in fact, the whole personnel. He lived there absolutely
      alone, and was the only European in this Arab village lost in the great
      spaces of the Sahara. This information I drew from him while he waited
      upon me at dinner, which I ate in solitude. My companions of the diligence
      were Arabs, who had melted away like ghosts into the desolation so soon as
      the diligence had rolled into the paved courtyard round which the
      one-storied house was built.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had finished dinner I lit a cigar. I was now quite alone in the
      bare <i>salle-à-manger</i>. The storm was at its height; the sand was
      driven like hail against the wooden shutters of the windows, and I felt
      dreary enough. The French driver was no doubt supping in the kitchen with
      the landlord, perhaps beside a fire, I began to long for company, for
      warmth, and I resolved to join them. I opened the door, therefore, and
      peered out into the passage. There was no sound of voices; but I saw a
      light at a little distance, went towards it, and found myself in a small
      kitchen, where the landlord was sitting alone by a red wood fire in the
      midst of his pots and pans, smoking a thin black cigar, and reading a
      dirty number of the <i>Journal Anti-Juif</i> of Algiers. He put it down
      politely as I came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're alone, monsieur," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, m'sieu. The driver has gone to see to the horses."
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered him one of my Havanas, which he accepted with alacrity, and drew
      up with him before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been living here long, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty years, m'sieu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty years alone in this desert place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nineteen years alone, m'sieu. Before that I had my little Marie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My child, m'sieu. She is buried in the sand behind the inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him in silence. His brown, wrinkled face was calm, but in his
      prominent eyes there was still the hot shining look I had observed in them
      when I arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The palms begin there," he added. "Year by year I have saved what I
      could, and now I have bought all the palm-trees near where she lies."
    </p>
    <p>
      He puffed away at his Havana.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You come from France?" I asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the Midi&mdash;I was born at Cassis, near Marseille."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you ever intend to go back there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, m'sieu. Would you have me desert my child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," I said gently, "she is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but I have promised her that her <i>bon papa</i> will lie with her
      presently for company. Leave her alone with the Arabs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden look of horror came into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't like the Arabs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the dirty dogs! You haven't been told about me, m'sieu?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only that your name was Fin Tireur.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Fin Tireur.' Yes; that's what they call me in the desert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a sportsman? A 'capital shot'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed suddenly, and his laugh made me feel cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! they don't call me 'Fin Tireur' because I can hit gazelle, and bring
      them home for supper. No, no! Shall I tell you why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me half defiantly, half wistfully, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if I do, perhaps your stomach will turn against the food I cooked
      with these hands," he added suddenly, stretching out his hands towards me,
      "You are English, m'sieu?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I daresay you won't understand." "I think I shall," I answered,
      looking full at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way he had spoken of his child had drawn me to him. Whatever he had
      done, I felt that chivalry and tenderness were in this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they call you 'Fin Tireur'?" "The men of the Midi, m'sieu, are not
      like the men of the rest of France," said Fin Tireur&mdash;"at least so
      they say. We are boasters, perhaps; but we've got more love of adventure,
      more wish to see the world, and do something big in it. They're talkers,
      you know, in the Midi, and they tell of what they've done. I heard them at
      Cassis when I was a boy, and one day I saw a Zouave in front of the inn
      balcony, where folks come on fête days to eat the bouillabaisse. The talk
      I had heard made me wish to rove; but when I saw the Zouave, in his big
      red trousers and blue and red jacket, I said to myself: 'As soon as my
      three years' service is over I'll go to Africa, and make my fortune.' I
      did my three years at Grenoble, m'sieu, and when it was done I carried out
      my resolve. I came to Africa; but I didn't come alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      He puffed at his cigar for a minute or two, and the hot look in his eyes
      became more definite, like a fanned flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You took a comrade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took a wife, a girl of Cassis. A good girl she was then."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused again, then continued, in rather a loud voice: "She was good,
      m'sieu, because she had seen nothing. That's often the way. It was I who
      put it into her head that there were things to be seen better than rocks,
      and dead white dusty roads, and fishing boats against the quay. I've
      thought of that since I&mdash;since I got my name of Fin Tireur. Her name
      was Marie, and she was eighteen when we stood before the priest. Next day
      we went to Marseille, and took the boat for Algiers. Our heads were full
      of I don't know what. We thought we were clever ones, and should do well
      in a country like Africa. And so we did at first. We got into a hotel at
      Algiers. She was housemaid, and I was porter in the hall, and what with
      the goings and comings&mdash;strangers giving us a little when we'd done
      our best for them&mdash;we made some money, and we saved it. And I wish to
      God we'd spent it, every sou!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice became fierce for a moment. Then he continued, with an obvious
      effort to be calm: "You see, m'sieu, at Algiers we had nothing to say to
      the Arabs. With the money we'd saved we left Algiers, and came into the
      desert to take a café which was to let near the station at Beni-Mora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've just come from there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They call it 'Au Retour du Sahara.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've had coffee there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was ours, and there little Marie was born. In those days there
      weren't many strangers in Beni-Mora. The railway had only just come there,
      and it was wild enough. Very few, except the Arabs. Well, they were often
      our customers. We learned to talk a bit of their language, and they a bit
      of ours; and, having no friends out there, I might say we made sort of
      friends with some of them. The dirty dogs! The camels!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck his clenched hand down on the table. As he talked he had lost
      his former consciousness of my close observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they know how to please women, m'sieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are often very handsome," I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't only that. They can stare a woman down as a wild beast can, and
      that's what women like. I never so much as looked on them as men&mdash;not
      in that way, for a Cassis woman, m'sieu. But Marie&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He choked, ground his teeth on his cigar stump, let it drop, and stamped
      out the glowing end on the brick floor with his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She served them, m'sieu," he resumed, after clearing his throat. "But I
      was mostly there, and I don't see how&mdash;but women can always find the
      way. Well, one day she went to what they call a sand-diviner. She didn't
      pretend anything. She told me she wanted to go, and I was ready. I was
      always ready that she should have any little pleasure. I couldn't leave
      the café, so she went off alone to a room he had by the Garden of the
      Gazelles, at the end of the dancing-street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know&mdash;over the place where they smoke the kief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She didn't answer, but went and sat down under the arbour, opposite to
      where they wash the clothes. I followed her, for she looked ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Did he read in the sand for you?' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes,' she said; 'he did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What things did he read?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She turned, and looked right at me. 'That my fate lies in the sand,' she
      said&mdash;'and yours, and hers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she pointed at little Marie, who was playing with a yellow kid we had
      then just by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's that to be afraid of?' I asked her. 'Haven't we come to the
      desert to make our fortune, and isn't there sand in the desert?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Not much by here,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's true, m'sieu. It's hard ground, you know, at Beni-Mora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," I said, offering him another cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He refused it with a quick gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She never would say another word as to what the sand-diviner had told
      her; but she was never the same from that day. She was as uneasy as a lost
      bitch, m'sieu; and she made me uneasy too. Sometimes she wouldn't speak to
      our little one when the child ran to her, and sometimes she'd catch her
      up, and kiss her till the little one's cheek was as red as if you'd been
      striking it. And then one day, after dark, she went."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Went!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd been ill with fever, and gone to spend the night at the sulphur
      baths; you know, m'sieu, Hammam-Salahkin, under the mountains. I came back
      just at dawn to open the café. When I got off my mule at the door I heard"&mdash;his
      face twitched convulsively&mdash;"the most horrible crying of a child. It
      was so horrible that I just stood there, holding on to the bridle of the
      mule, and listening, and didn't dare go in. I'd heard children cry often
      enough before; but&mdash;<i>mon Dieu!</i>&mdash;never like that. At last I
      dropped the bridle, and went in, with my legs shaking under me. I found
      the little one alone in the house, and like a mad thing. She'd been alone
      all night."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face set rigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And her mother knew I should be all night at the Hammam," he said. "Fin
      Tireur&mdash;yes, it was coming back, and finding my little one left like
      that in such a place, made me earn the name."
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell suddenly into a moody silence. I broke it by saying: "It was the
      sand-diviner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me sharply. "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never found out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Beni-Mora the women go veiled," he said harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I realised the horror of the situation: the deserted husband
      living on with his child in the midst of the ordained and close secrecy of
      Beni-Mora, where many of the women never set foot out of doors, and those
      who do, unless they are the public dancers, are so heavily veiled that
      their features cannot be recognised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I searched, as far as one can search in an Arab town, and found out
      nothing. I wanted to tear the veil from every woman in the place; and then
      I was sent away from Beni-Mora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The French authorities, my own countrymen," he laughed bitterly. "To save
      me from getting myself murdered, m'sieu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would have been."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Then I came here to keep the inn for the diligence that carries
      the mails to the south, for I wouldn't leave the country till&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the sand-diviner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left him at Beni-Mora. He smiled, and said he knew no more than I; and
      perhaps he didn't. How was I to tell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your name of Fin Tireur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"&mdash;the thing in his eyes glowed like a thing red-hot&mdash;"I'd
      been here eleven months when, one afternoon of summer, just near sunset, I
      heard a noise of drums beating and African pipes screaming, and the snarl
      of camels on the road you came to-night. I was in the house, in this room
      where we are sitting now, and little Marie was playing just outside by the
      well, so that I could see her through the window. By the sounds, I knew a
      great caravan was coming up, and passing towards the south. They always
      water at the well, and I stood by the window to see them. Little Marie
      stood too, shading her eyes with her bit of a hand. The drums and pipes
      got louder, and round the corner of the inn came as big a caravan as I've
      ever seen; near a hundred camels, horsemen, and led mules and donkeys,
      Kabyle dogs and goats, the music playing all the time, and a Caïd's flag
      flying in the front. They made for the well, as I knew they would, and
      little Marie stood all the while watching them. M'sieu, there were square
      packs on some of the camels, and veiled women on the packs."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked across at me hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Veiled women?" I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When they got to the well they made the camels kneel for the women to get
      down; and one of the women, when she was down, caught sight of Marie
      standing there, with her little hand shading her eyes. That woman gave a
      great cry behind her veil. I heard it, m'sieu, as I stood by the window
      there, and I saw the woman run at the little one."
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up from his seat slowly, and stood by the wooden shutter, against
      which the sand was driven by the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a place like this, m'sieu, one keeps a revolver here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand to a pocket at the back of his breeches, brought out a
      revolver, and pointed it at the shutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I heard the woman cry I took my revolver out. When I saw the woman
      run I fired, and the bullet struck the veil."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the revolver back into his pocket, and sat down again quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's why they call me Fin Tireur."
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing, and sat staring at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the camels had been watered the caravan went on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;but the Arabs&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Caïd had the body tied across a donkey&mdash;they told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't see?"
    </p>

      "No. I took the little one in. She was screaming, and I had to see to her.
      It was two days afterwards, when I was at the market, that a scorpion
      stung her. She was dead when I came back. Well, m'sieu, are you sorry you
      ate your supper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I could reply, the door opening into the courtyard gaped, and the
      driver entered, followed by a cloud of whirling sand grains.

    <p>
      "<i>Nom d'un chien!</i>" he exclaimed. "Get me a tumbler of wine, for the
      love of God, Fin Tireur. My throat's full of the sand. <i>Sacré nom d'un
      nom d'un nom!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled off his coat, turned it upside down, and shook the sand out of
      the pockets, while Fin Tireur went over to the corner of the kitchen where
      the bottles stood in a row against the earthen wall.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
